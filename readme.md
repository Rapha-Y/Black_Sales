Mandatory:
MAKE THINGS PRETTIER!!

Optional:
Add pagination to products displayed - Needs bigger test sample.
Add ability to edit your profile - Or remove edit buttons form the UI.
Disable ability to buy from yourself - Not relevant to the project, but would make sense if the site was real.

Dangerous:
Add ability to edit your products - Not ideal since it'd mess with the way orders/purchases work. Would require a complete rework of the database.

Final touches:
Refactor code (last step)
Write readme (actual last step)
