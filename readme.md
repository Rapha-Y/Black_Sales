Mandatory:
Fix site flick on load

Optional:
Add pagination to products displayed - Needs bigger test sample.
Remove edit buttons from profile - But allow user to change passwords.
Disable ability to buy from yourself - Not relevant to the project, but would make sense if the site was real.

Final touches:
Refactor code (last step)
Write readme (actual last step)
